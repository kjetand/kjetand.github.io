From time to time I put out jazz records for sale.
Don't hesitate to contact me through Instagram

or [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/user/kjetand)
if you want to buy records from me or have any questions.

## Shipping

**Buyer pays shipping.**
Price for international buyers outside Norway may vary from approximately `â‚¬20-30`.
I ship records in their inner and outer sleeve.
Record is on the outside of cover to prevent splits.
I use bubble wrap and good outside cardboard material designed for shipping vinyl.
Records are not moving inside my packages!

## Grading

Currently I use the _Goldmine Standard_ for grading vinyl
with a slight modification:
added the `EX` (excellent) grade which is a higher-end `VG+` (alternatively lower-end `NM`).
Condition of an item is marked with `[vinyl/cover]`
(e.g. `[NM/VG+]` for Near Mint vinyl and Very Good plus cover).
