Hi there!
My name is Kjetil Andresen, and welcome to my website.
I got three passion interests in my life that I want to share:

- **Jazz vinyl collecting:** I've early on in my life had great interest in music,
  and in the last 5 years especially _Jazz_.
  I collect exclusively vintage jazz records, mostly first pressings.
- **Software engineering:** I work professionally as a software engineer in
  Tromso Norway. I know many technologies, but my main interests are `Rust`
  and `C++` programming languages.
- **Basketball:** I have ~20 years of coaching experience in basketball
  at all levels in Norway, and 10 years of youth national teams (U16 and U18).
